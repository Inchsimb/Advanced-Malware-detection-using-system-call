# Advanced malware detection using system call.
The project "Advanced Malware Detection Using System Call Data" focuses on improving the detection of malware, which is software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. Traditional malware detection techniques, such as signature-based detection, have limitations, especially against new or unknown (zero-day) malware. This project aims to overcome these limitations by using a more advanced method: analyzing system call data.
